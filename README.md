# QPSK-generator
I/Q generator for Metop, Aqua and NOAA20.
Using external oscillator any datarate up to 55 MHz (or more) can be realized.

Fits in EPM240 CPLD; use Quartus lite (free software) to synthesize and load the code.

Direct programming: use files in the zip-file, vhdl files not needed.
(Currently Linux only, needs a bat file for Windwos. Not tested yet...)
